How to start a PostgreSQL on LINUX

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27107557/what-is-the-default-password-for-postgres
	- edit `pg_hba.conf`; i.e. postgres13 installed on `/etc`: `sudo gedit /etc/postgresql/13/main/pg_hba.conf`:
		- set the first two authentication modes, that is default `peer` or `md5` to `trust`.
		- set the password of `postgres` with: `ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'insertSomePassword';`sql
		- **NOTE**: PSQL9 and before used a default password of 'admin'; however, newer ones have a `NULL` password that is impossible to type and yields a `FATAL` error that no password is given when prompted; even though the password does not exist.
		- **IMPORTANT**: it is helpful to create a `root` and `$USERNAME` user in case some commands default psql authentication to these usernames. This usually yields FATAL errors for "incorrect password" even though these users do not exist.
	- Restart `postgresql.services`: `sudo systemctl postgresql.services`sh
	- Edit `pg_hba.conf`; This time set the changed authentication modes to `md5`.
	- Restart `postgresql.services`.
	- Go onto pgAdmin (to install pgAdmin, one must first install the PPA first). One can create a `root` and `$USERNAME` users for a dummy database in GUI. Provide them with ALL permissions.
	- To edit the passwords of the new users by CLI: `ALTER USER username PASSWORD 'newPassword';`sql.
	- Create a databse named `$USERNAME` because otherwise SQL may not connect correctly without `$ psql postgres`sh ($USERNAME is the default argument for `$ psql`sh).
- To seed the database: `sudo createdb -U USERNAME -W databaseName < databaseSeedFile.sql`sh OR `sudo createdb databaseName < databaseSeedFile.sql`sh
	- Forgetting `createdb` will yield a `FATAL` error that the database does not exist.
	- One has to seed the database by `psql databaseName < databaseNameSeedFile.sql`sh
